  <div class="about">

    <p>Hello there! I am Vikas Lalwani and welcome to my small corner of the internet.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about <a href="/projects/">building things</a> for the web, learning new technologies and having some fun along the way! Currently I devote most of my time to frontend side of things, but I am not afraid to dig into backend or any other tech to get my job done.</p>

    <ul>
      Fun stuff:
      <li>I got an opportunity to contribute to CSS-Tricks, which is one of the most respected websites for frontend development (and my favourite!)</li>
      <li>My apps were featured on front page of CodePen. Twice!</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      Not so fun stuff:
      <li>I am familiar with JavaScript/ES6, React, HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design. </li>
      <li>And I have dabbled in Angular, Node, Express, jQuery, SASS, and DynamoDB.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't know everything, but I know enough to be able to figure rest of the stuff out. And I like figuring things out on my own. This website contains my journey on the web in the form of my guest contributions, projects, and blog. This website contains my journey on the web in the form of my <a href="/writing.html">guest contributions</a>, <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, and <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

    <p>I am always on the lookout for exciting new projects. Feel free to reach out if you have some interesting ideas that you would want me to work on, or if you want to collaborate with me on a project. Or to just say hi!</p>
