day: 15

It's a relatively straightforward project today - the famous 'This Day in History' clone. If you open the page it will tell you all the historical events that happened on this day.

You can test is out here: [http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/this-day-in-history/](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/this-day-in-history/).

Key Points:
---
- It uses Wikipedia's API to pull the relevant data.
- Relies on JSONP because of CORS restriction imposed by Wikipedia's API.
- Minimalist layout.
