title: Typing Test
day: 7

It's a very small project today called 'Typing Test'. App will generate a random paragraph and a typing window to type in. You'll have 60 seconds to type in and after that you'll get your typing speed.

You can try the app here: [http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/typing-test/](http://vikaslalwani.com/projects/typing-test/).

The reason for this small project was that there was a major power cut in my area. How much you might ask? 9 hours :( It was extremely frustrating. I got up with a complete different idea for today's project  but instead ended up making this because if lack of time.

There is only one thing that is really annoying me in this app. Paragraphs are coming from the same js file instead of different JSON file. I plan to fix it tomorrow. Other than that everything was pretty straightforward.
